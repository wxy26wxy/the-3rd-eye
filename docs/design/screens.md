# Screens · web

Board names follow the design canvas (Direction A, green and playful). Every screen uses tokens from `web/app/tokens.css` through the primitives in `web/components/ui/*`; copy is in `web/messages/en.json`.

Shared frame: `components/create/CreateScreen` (back button, step pill, display headline, scalloped cream bottom sheet with the actions). Mascot: `components/Tag.tsx` (`listening`, `cheering`, `waving`).

## Accessibility deviations from the design

- **Display headlines on green**: cream fill on `ground` is about 1.9:1. The 2 px ink stroke and 5 px ink shadow carry the letterforms, and every display headline is also real text. On cream surfaces display text uses ink fill instead of cream (`tone="onCream"`).
- **Nav links on phones** are cream pills on green instead of bare text, so each is a 44 px target with readable contrast; the desktop nav keeps the bare-text style.
- **Selected state** is shown by the lime background *and* a filled check circle, so it does not rely on colour alone. Every choice is a native radio.
- **Starburst badge** text is part of the choice's accessible name ("Say it out loud … No pen needed!").
- **Focus**: a 3 px ink outline with a 3 px offset everywhere (the design has no focus state).
- **Motion**: Tag's waving and hopping, the listening bars and the loading dots stop under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **High contrast**: the generated tokens switch under `prefers-contrast: more`; the grain overlay turns off.
- **Mic screens** always offer "Type instead"; the clarifying question is spoken *and* shown, with a "Hear the question again" button.
- **File pickers** are native inputs (visually hidden over a pill face), so they work with VoiceOver and the keyboard.
